%description
urllib3 is a powerful, user-friendly HTTP client for Python. urllib3 brings
many critical features that are missing from the Python standard libraries:

  • Thread safety.
  • Connection pooling.
  • Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
  • File uploads with multipart encoding.
  • Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
  • Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.
  • Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
  • 100% test coverage.}

# Make sure that the RECENT_DATE value doesn't get too far behind what the current date is.
# RECENT_DATE must not be older that 2 years from the build time, or else test_recent_date
# (from test/test_connection.py) would fail. However, it shouldn't be to close to the build time either,
# since a user's system time could be set to a little in the past from what build time is (because of timezones,
# corner cases, etc). As stated in the comment in src/urllib3/connection.py:
#   When updating RECENT_DATE, move it to within two years of the current date,
#   and not less than 6 months ago.
#   Example: if Today is 2018-01-01, then RECENT_DATE should be any date on or
#   after 2016-01-01 (today - 2 years) AND before 2017-07-01 (today - 6 months)
# There is also a test_ssl_wrong_system_time test (from test/with_dummyserver/test_https.py) that tests if
# user's system time isn't set as too far in the past, because it could lead to SSL verification errors.
# That is why we need RECENT_DATE to be set at most 2 years ago (or else test_ssl_wrong_system_time would
# result in false positive), but before at least 6 month ago (so this test could tolerate user's system time being
# set to some time in the past, but not to far away from the present).
# Next few lines update RECENT_DATE dynamically.
recent_date=$(date --date "7 month ago" +"%Y, %_m, %_d")
